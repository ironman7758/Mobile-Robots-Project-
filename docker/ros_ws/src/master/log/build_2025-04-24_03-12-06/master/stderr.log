[33mCMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findros.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "ros", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ros" with any of
  the following names:

    rosConfig.cmake
    ros-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ros" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "ros_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "ros" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
